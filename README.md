# serverscripts
misc scripts used for server maintenance/quality of life bash stuff

### clear_deluge.sh
  - deluge-console keeps a list of all current/previous torrents and this script clears out that list

### ip_notify.py
  - currently my server is on a dynamic ip so this script is used to send me an email if my ip ever changes
